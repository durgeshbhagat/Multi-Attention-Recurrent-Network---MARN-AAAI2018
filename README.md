# MARN - AAAI18
Code for [Multi-attention Recurrent Network - AAAI 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00923)

### Dependencies / Notes
MARN is written in pytorch with some code fragments (1. LSTM Hybrid and 2. Multi Attention Head) copied from CMU-Multimodal SDK https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK/.
  - The code is developed with Python 3.6 and Pytorch 1.2.0 (with GPU support) on Linux
  - For reasons of my convenience data is required to be `data_dir = ../../data` -- errors might pop-up when other directories are used.
  - The model can be executed by running MARN.py.
